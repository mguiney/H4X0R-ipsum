# H4X0R-ipsum
Silly cli-accessible lorem ipsum generator for the 1337 among us, because technical demos should be fun and i'm tired of mass-copypasting from http://hackeripsum.com/

If this wasn't obvious already, this isn't like a "show off my skillset" project, it's just a quick tool for autogenerating content for a wiki whose skillset i'm going to be demoing for some folks.
